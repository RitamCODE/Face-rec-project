# Face-rec-project

About this project:

This project uses face recognition to login a user and enable access to the data that he has stored in the website. 
Basically it stores a user's id and password for a particular website and that user will only be granted access to the database if the user is 
verified through face recognition
Anybody who has access to your computer has access to the saved passwords in your google account. This website therfore verifies the user using seamless 
face recognition before getting access to passwords. Therefore there is no need of remembering, this website will remember both the password and you face
